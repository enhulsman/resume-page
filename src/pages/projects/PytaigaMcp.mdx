# pytaiga-mcp — Open Source Contribution

A [merged pull request](https://github.com/talhaorak/pytaiga-mcp/pull/5) to [pytaiga-mcp](https://github.com/talhaorak/pytaiga-mcp), an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that integrates Taiga project management with AI assistants. The contribution addressed three areas — security, AI context efficiency, and code quality — reducing server code by 14% and adding the project's first test suite.

## Security Hardening

- **Credential Protection**: Introduced a config module using Pydantic's `SecretStr` so that passwords and tokens are masked in all logs, tracebacks, and `repr()` output — credentials cannot leak even in unhandled exceptions
- **Auto-Authentication**: Server authenticates on startup using environment variables, eliminating the manual auth step users previously had to perform before every session
- **Input Validation**: Added parameter allowlists per resource type to reject unexpected input
- **Session Masking**: Session IDs display only the first 8 characters in logs

## AI Context Efficiency

Added a response filtering system with three verbosity levels:

- **minimal**: Core fields only (id, ref, subject, status, project)
- **standard** (default): Useful fields including version for updates
- **full**: Complete API response for backward compatibility

This reduces token usage — a user story list response goes from ~50 fields to 5 in minimal mode.

## Code Quality

- **Centralized Error Handling**: Refactored with a `_execute_taiga_operation()` helper that eliminated duplicated try/catch blocks across every endpoint, reducing `server.py` by ~207 lines (14%)
- **Dependency Cleanup**: Removed 3 unused dependencies (fastapi, uvicorn, httpx) and consolidated 3 linting tools (black, isort, flake8) down to 1 (ruff)
- **Testing & CI**: Added the project's first test suite — 11 unit tests with pytest — plus a CI pipeline with matrix testing across Python 3.10–3.12

## Outcome

The PR was reviewed and merged by the maintainer. All changes are included in the released package.
